# AJAX

This demonstrates basic AJAX requests using plain JavaScript `XMLHttpRequest` Object
as well as using the jQuery `ajax()` method.

To use this example, enter a name such as *Yannick*, *Mary*, *Marsha* or *Tom*. Take a look
at the message that is displayed once you click **Search**. Also try leaving the search
field blank to see what message is printed then.

You can also click the **Search jQuery** button to make the AJAX request using jQuery.
